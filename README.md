## Swellio
A web app where surfers in Los Angeles can sign up to receive text notifications about wave conditions. By filling out the provided form, users can select which surf breaks to track and the conditions quality threshold to trigger notification. For example, a user may choose to receive a text only when the waves at Venice Beakwater and/or El Porto are at least "Very Good". The conditions follow [Surfline's Surf Quality Scale](https://www.surfline.com/surf-science/rating-of-surf-heights-and-quality_31942/).

## Motivation
The inspiration for Swellio came when I missed a day of very good surf because I was working on a project and hadn't checked Surfline in a while. As days of very good surf are few and far between where I live, Swellio is my attempt at preventing that from happening again.
